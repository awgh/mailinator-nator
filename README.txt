This requires urllib2.

You may have to make some changes to get the desired result...

I just wrote these to demonstrate why it's not a good idea to have a
single-factor 'forgot password' form, or why you should make use of 
mailinator's 'delete this email immediately' feature.

I love mailinator, and this doesn't seem to violate their terms of service.
Looking at their site, they don't seem to have terms of service!

However, use or possesion of these scripts may be construed as illegal 
depending on your jurisdiction. 

No express purpose or warranty is expressed or implied.  Use at own risk.

First, use forgot-pwd-force to trigger emails to mailinator
addresses.  

Second, use mailinator-scan to collect the responses using the
same wordlist!

Alternatively,  simply troll mailinator by using mailinator-scan as a 
cron job...
